✅ Blockchain-Based Lost and Found System

📘 Project Description

The **Blockchain-Based Lost and Found System** is a simple application designed to help students securely register lost or found items within a college campus. The main goal of the project is to provide a **transparent, tamper-proof, and trustworthy** method for tracking items such as ID cards, laptops, books, bags, pendrives, etc.

This project uses a **blockchain-like structure**, where every item entry (lost or found) is stored inside a block. Each block contains the item details, timestamp, and the hash of the previous block, making the entire chain **immutable** and secure. Once data is added, it cannot be edited or deleted, ensuring trust and transparency.

The system provides simple menu options:

* Register a **Lost Item**
* Register a **Found Item**
* Search for Item by ID
* View complete blockchain records

Whenever a student reports a lost or found item, a new block is created and added to the blockchain. Searching is easy — students can type the item ID to see if someone has found their item. This eliminates confusion and prevents misuse of information.


 🎯 Purpose of the Project

* To build a secure and trustworthy lost & found tracking system.
* To prevent data tampering and ensure transparency.
* To apply basic blockchain concepts in a real-world college scenario.
* To show how block hashing and immutability can enhance security.



🛠 Technology Used

* Python (Core language)
* SHA-256 Hashing (For block security)
* Blockchain Data Structure (Chain of blocks)


⭐Key Features

* Simple and user-friendly system
* Easy registration of lost and found items
* Search items by unique ID
* Blockchain ensures records cannot be altered
* Secure and transparent tracking system
* Good demonstration of blockchain fundamentals


📦 Modules

1. Block Module – Creates each block with item data
2. Blockchain Module – Maintains the entire chain of blocks
3. Lost Item Module – Records lost item details
4. Found Item Module – Records found item details
5. Search Module – Finds items by ID
6. Display Module – Shows full blockchain


📚 Applications

* Used in colleges to track lost items
* Prevents duplicate claims
* Ensures secure and tamper-free record keeping
* Can be extended to shops, malls, offices, airports


🧪 Conclusion

The Blockchain-Based Lost and Found System demonstrates how blockchain technology can be applied beyond cryptocurrencies. It provides a transparent, secure, and efficient way to manage lost-and-found items. This project is simple to implement yet powerful enough to showcase the core principles of blockchain such as **hashing, chaining, immutability, and transparency**.
